1. Modern web application use SPA (Single Page Application)

2. We no need to reload the whole page when request to the server. Instead only return a Json file

3. Based on my research, both SPA and MPA (Multi Page Application) has pros and cons

4. If you want to have a SEO-friendly web app, go for MPA. Otherwise, choose SPA
